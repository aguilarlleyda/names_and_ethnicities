# From roots to cribs: an exploration of ethnicity and baby naming trends in New York City
### Data analysis and visualization project exploring how the different ethnicities in New York City give names to their babies

In bustling metropolises, diverse ethnicities coexist. Despite residing side by side, these communities exhibit unique traits in their culinary preferences, fashion choices, and linguistic nuances. This project delves into yet another difference: the names these ethnicities give to their children. Focusing on the unparalleled multiculturalism of New York City, this study [a comprehensive dataset available on the US Government' Open Data portal](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names) spanning the years 2011 to 2019, documenting every name given to newborns in the city. The dataset categorizes names by gender and four overarching ethnic groups: Asian-Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, and White. Analyzing this wealth of data, I explore frequent names and examine the variations in their popularity across different ethnicities. Additionally, I introduce a measure of naming overlap, shedding light on which communities share similar naming trends and which boast distinctive naming conventions. The study concludes by investigating whether names experienced an increase or decrease in shared usage throughout the 2010s decade.
